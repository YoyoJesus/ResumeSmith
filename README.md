# ResumeSmith

ResumeSmith is a privacy-conscious resume builder for forging polished, job-ready resumes with live Typst rendering, PDF export, AI-assisted parsing, O\*NET occupation data, and session-scoped custom templates.

## Features

- Edit resume content in the browser and preview the rendered document as you work, including sections for experience, projects, clearance, achievements, publications, presentations, and custom sections you name yourself (grants, teaching, service, and so on).
- Move repeated entries and bullet points with keyboard-accessible up/down buttons. Their order is saved in the browser and used in Typst/PDF output; whole sections remain reorderable in the Layout tab.
- The document preview initially fits the whole page. Zoom from 50% to 200%, fit the panel width, or fit the whole page again; the selected zoom survives editing and switching between Code and Preview. These view controls do not change the exported PDF.
- Use **Fullscreen** beside the zoom controls to open a nearly full-screen preview with the same page and zoom selection. Close it with **Close fullscreen preview** or Escape.
- Switch between a one-page resume and a multi-page academic CV. CV mode uses a template with running headers, "Page N of M" numbering, and looser spacing, shows the page count instead of the one-page warning, and hides O\*NET tailoring, which does not apply to academic CVs.
- Record publications with authors, venue, volume, issue, pages, DOI, and status (published, in press, under review), with your own name in bold. In CV mode, optionally add a BibTeX (`.bib`) file, rendered by Typst in APA, Chicago author-date, IEEE, or MLA style.
- Export a polished PDF using the bundled Typst WebAssembly compiler.
- Download a versioned JSON backup of editable resume data and restore it in another browser after reviewing a summary and confirming replacement. Backups contain personal information, so keep them private. This browser-only flow does not call AI or a server. The selected O\*NET occupation is included; session-scoped custom templates and CV bibliography files are not. A current session template remains active after restore.
- Download the Typst source of the resume. With no resume content yet, the download is the active template with only your styling choices and no personal data.
- Copy or download readable plain-text resume content for pasting into application forms. The text comes directly from the form fields and follows your section order; it is not an ATS score or a guarantee of parser compatibility.
- Pick separate heading and body fonts, and adjust font sizes with sliders or 0.5 pt steps.
- Import TXT, DOCX, or PDF resumes and CVs through a review-and-consent gate before AI parsing. Long CVs are sent in bounded parts and stitched back together in the browser.
- Extract selectable PDF text locally and use Tesseract OCR only on pages that need it.
- Search O\*NET occupations and use AI-assisted suggestions to tailor resume content.
- Upload a compatible Typst template for the current browser session, separately for the resume and the CV.
- Convert a DOCX template into a contract-safe Typst design with AI assistance.

## Privacy and upload behavior

Resume files are processed in the browser first. The upload gate shows extraction method, page and word counts, text quality, OCR confidence when applicable, and a text preview. Clicking **Send to AI and fill in my resume/CV** provides explicit consent to send the extracted text and its metrics to `/api/extract`; the original file is not uploaded to that endpoint. There is no separate consent checkbox.

Current resume-upload limits are:

- 5 MB source file
- 10 PDF pages (30 when importing an academic CV)
- OCR on at most 4 PDF pages
- 120,000 extracted characters

An academic CV import splits the extracted text in the browser into parts of about 10,000 characters, breaking at section headings where it can, and sends them to `/api/extract` one at a time after the same consent step. The server accepts at most 12,000 characters per part and 16 parts per document, and uses a separate CV schema, so resume extraction requests are unchanged. Each part counts toward the AI rate limit below; the browser waits for `Retry-After` when it is reached. If a part fails, the parts that succeeded are kept and you can retry only the failed parts or continue without them.

Resume data (including the document type), the selected O\*NET occupation, and an optional CV BibTeX file (up to 256 KB) are stored in browser `localStorage`, along with whether the footer is collapsed. The BibTeX file is never sent to the server or to AI; it is compiled in the browser and rejected if Typst cannot read it. Custom templates are stored in `sessionStorage`, take precedence over the built-in template, and are removed when that browser session ends or the user resets the template. Use **More → Your data → Delete saved data** to remove ResumeSmith's saved resume/CV, occupation, bibliography, footer preference, and custom templates from this browser; other sites' storage on the same origin is left alone. The editor resets to a blank resume, and future edits are saved again.

The Typst compiler downloads its built-in fonts from jsDelivr. Web fonts (Carlito, Lato, Open Sans, Roboto) are downloaded from the Fontsource CDN on jsDelivr only when selected in the Fonts tab.

The deployed site uses Vercel Web Analytics to count anonymous page views. It does not use cookies and does not receive resume content, templates, or uploaded files.

AI-backed routes use stateless Vercel functions and request `store: false` from OpenAI. This project has no database or persistent server-side file storage.

## Local development

Requirements:

- A current Node.js LTS release
- npm
- An OpenAI API key for resume parsing, AI tailoring, and DOCX template conversion
- An O\*NET Web Services key for occupation search and details

From the repository root:

```sh
cd web
npm install
```

Copy `web/.env.example` to `web/.env`, add the keys you intend to use, then start the app:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The browser-only editor and Typst export work without API keys. Features backed by their corresponding serverless routes require the relevant key.

## Custom templates

A custom `.typ` file must implement the same `resume`, section-heading, and `skills` helper contract as the built-in template and include this marker. The resume and the academic CV each keep their own session template, validated against a resume or CV fixture; custom sections, presentations, and CV references are built from the existing helpers and plain Typst markup, so templates written for the resume keep working:

```typst
// ========== RESUME CONTENT ==========
```

The app replaces content after the marker with the resume generated from the form, then compiles the complete document in the browser before activating it. Typst templates are limited to 1 MB.

Use [the example custom template](docs/examples/modern-teal.typ) or download the built-in template from the upload dialog as a starting point. The starter file keeps your colors, fonts, and section order but contains no resume content. DOCX templates are limited to 4 MB so multipart uploads remain below Vercel's request limit; their supported layout and style are converted into Typst, while Word-only effects and images may be approximated or omitted.

## Deployment

API requests reject foreign `Origin` and Fetch Metadata headers. A bounded in-memory limiter allows each client IP 6 AI requests and 60 O\*NET GET requests per minute, with the AI quota shared across extraction, tailoring, and template conversion. Rejections return JSON with HTTP 429 and `Retry-After`. Requests without browser headers still consume quota. Limits are best-effort per serverless instance: cold starts and multiple instances reset or multiply them, and they are not authentication or a deployment-wide spending cap. Client addresses come from the deployment adapter, which reports the `x-forwarded-for` chain; only the rightmost entry is used as the bucket key, since a caller controls everything before the address the deployment proxy appends. Adapters without client-address support share a fallback bucket. No database is used.

Before public deployment, configure provider budget alerts and review available account spending controls. Monitor usage and revoke the key or disable AI routes if necessary; do not rely on budget alerts or the in-memory limiter as a hard spending ceiling. Apply deployment-level firewall controls when available for your plan.

All API routes have a 60-second execution limit. O*NET calls time out after 10 seconds; OpenAI calls time out after 35 seconds with no automatic retries, leaving headroom for tailoring's sequential O*NET and OpenAI stages. Extraction JSON is bounded to 736,384 bytes before parsing, including escaped text and metadata, and filenames are limited to 255 characters. Client metrics only supply an allowlisted extraction method; quality checks are recomputed on the server. DOCX multipart requests are bounded to 4 MB plus 64 KB of form overhead while streaming; individual files still have the 4 MB limit. Model output is capped per route (16,000 tokens for resume extraction, 10,000 per CV part, 8,000 for tailoring, 4,000 for template conversion) so a single request cannot run up an unbounded bill; a response truncated by that cap is reported as a parse failure rather than parsed as a fragment.

The application targets Vercel Hobby and uses `web/` as the project root. Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ONET_API_KEY` in the Vercel project when their features are needed. The app is designed for stateless serverless execution and does not require a database or writable persistent filesystem.

The footer shows a build version. Production deployments are labeled `YYYY.MM.DD.PR`, combining the UTC build date with the pull request number GitHub adds to the merge commit subject (`title (#66)` or `Merge pull request #66 ...`); a production build without a PR number falls back to `YYYY.MM.DD+<short SHA>`. Preview deployments and local development show `Dev`. The label is computed in `vite.config.ts` from Vercel's `VERCEL_ENV`, `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE`, and `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` system environment variables, so keep **Automatically expose System Environment Variables** enabled in the Vercel project settings (the default). No manual configuration is needed.
