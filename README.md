# ResumeSmith

ResumeSmith is a privacy-conscious resume builder for forging polished, job-ready resumes with live Typst rendering, PDF export, AI-assisted parsing, O\*NET occupation data, and session-scoped custom templates.

[Try the deployed app](https://rg.barknote.top)

## Features

- Edit resume content in the browser and preview the rendered document as you work, including sections for experience, projects, clearance, achievements, and publications.
- Export a polished PDF using the bundled Typst WebAssembly compiler.
- Import TXT, DOCX, or PDF resumes through a review-and-consent gate before AI parsing.
- Extract selectable PDF text locally and use Tesseract OCR only on pages that need it.
- Search O\*NET occupations and use AI-assisted suggestions to tailor resume content.
- Upload a compatible Typst template for the current browser session.
- Convert a DOCX template into a contract-safe Typst design with AI assistance.

## Privacy and upload behavior

Resume files are processed in the browser first. The upload gate shows extraction method, page and word counts, text quality, OCR confidence when applicable, and a text preview. The user must explicitly consent before the extracted text and its metrics are sent to `/api/extract`; the original file is not uploaded to that endpoint.

Current resume-upload limits are:

- 5 MB source file
- 10 PDF pages
- OCR on at most 4 PDF pages
- 120,000 extracted characters

Resume data and the selected O\*NET occupation are stored in browser `localStorage`. Custom templates are stored in `sessionStorage`, take precedence over the built-in template, and are removed when that browser session ends or the user resets the template.

AI-backed routes use stateless Vercel functions and request `store: false` from OpenAI. This project has no database or persistent server-side file storage.

## Local development

Requirements:

- A current Node.js LTS release
- npm
- An OpenAI API key for resume parsing, AI tailoring, and DOCX template conversion
- An O\*NET Web Services key for occupation search and details

From the repository root:

```sh
cd web
npm install
```

Copy `web/.env.example` to `web/.env`, add the keys you intend to use, then start the app:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The browser-only editor and Typst export work without API keys. Features backed by their corresponding serverless routes require the relevant key.

## Custom templates

A custom `.typ` file must implement the same `resume`, section-heading, and `skills` helper contract as the built-in template and include this marker:

```typst
// ========== RESUME CONTENT ==========
```

The app replaces content after the marker with the resume generated from the form, then compiles the complete document in the browser before activating it. Typst templates are limited to 1 MB.

Use [the example custom template](docs/examples/modern-teal.typ) or download the built-in template from the upload dialog as a starting point. DOCX templates are limited to 4 MB so multipart uploads remain below Vercel's request limit; their supported layout and style are converted into Typst, while Word-only effects and images may be approximated or omitted.

## Deployment

API requests reject foreign `Origin` and Fetch Metadata headers. A bounded in-memory limiter allows each client IP 6 AI requests and 60 O\*NET GET requests per minute, with the AI quota shared across extraction, tailoring, and template conversion. Rejections return JSON with HTTP 429 and `Retry-After`. Requests without browser headers still consume quota. Limits are best-effort per serverless instance: cold starts and multiple instances reset or multiply them, and they are not authentication or a deployment-wide spending cap. Client addresses come from the deployment adapter, which reports the `x-forwarded-for` chain; only the rightmost entry is used as the bucket key, since a caller controls everything before the address the deployment proxy appends. Adapters without client-address support share a fallback bucket. No database is used.

Before public deployment, configure provider budget alerts and review available account spending controls. Monitor usage and revoke the key or disable AI routes if necessary; do not rely on budget alerts or the in-memory limiter as a hard spending ceiling. Apply deployment-level firewall controls when available for your plan.

All API routes have a 60-second execution limit. O*NET calls time out after 10 seconds; OpenAI calls time out after 35 seconds with no automatic retries, leaving headroom for tailoring's sequential O*NET and OpenAI stages. Extraction JSON is bounded to 736,384 bytes before parsing, including escaped text and metadata, and filenames are limited to 255 characters. Client metrics only supply an allowlisted extraction method; quality checks are recomputed on the server. DOCX multipart requests are bounded to 4 MB plus 64 KB of form overhead while streaming; individual files still have the 4 MB limit. Model output is capped per route (16,000 tokens for extraction, 8,000 for tailoring, 4,000 for template conversion) so a single request cannot run up an unbounded bill; a response truncated by that cap is reported as a parse failure rather than parsed as a fragment.

The application targets Vercel Hobby and uses `web/` as the project root. Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ONET_API_KEY` in the Vercel project when their features are needed. The app is designed for stateless serverless execution and does not require a database or writable persistent filesystem.
